- [ ] Logout action
- [ ] Auth middleware — protect all `/dashboard/*` routes
- [ ] Role + scope detection on session (loads user's role + assigned locations)
- [ ] Redirect after login based on role (admin → `/admin`, manager → `/manager`, staff → `/staff`)
- [ ] Layout shells per role (sidebar navigation)
- [ ] `/lib/scope.ts` — helpers: `getUserScope(userId)`, `assertCanAccessLocation(userId, locationId)`, `filterShiftsByScope(query, userId)`

### Constraint Engine (`/lib/constraints.ts`)
- [ ] `checkDoubleBooking(userId, startUtc, endUtc, excludeShiftId?)` — returns violation or null
- [ ] `checkRestPeriod(userId, startUtc, endUtc, excludeShiftId?)` — 10h minimum gap check
- [ ] `checkSkillMatch(userId, requiredSkillId)` — returns violation or null
- [ ] `checkLocationCertification(userId, locationId)` — returns violation if no cert or revoked
- [ ] `checkAvailability(userId, locationId, startUtc, endUtc)` — converts to user's home tz, checks recurring windows + exceptions
- [ ] `checkDailyHours(userId, date, additionalHours, locationTimezone)` — warn >8h, block >12h
- [ ] `checkWeeklyHours(userId, weekStart, additionalHours)` — warn >35h, block >40h (with override path)
- [ ] `checkConsecutiveDays(userId, date)` — warn on 6th, block on 7th (with override path)
- [ ] `checkHeadcountAvailable(shiftId)` — ensures shift not already at headcount
- [ ] `runAllConstraints(userId, shiftId)` — runs all checks, returns array of violations with severity
- [ ] `suggestAlternatives(shiftId, failedUserId)` — returns up to 3 qualified, available, in-scope staff
- [ ] Unit test each constraint with edge cases (overnight, DST, cross-location, revoked cert)

### Timezone Utilities (`/lib/timezone.ts`)

- [ ] `isOvernightShift(startUtc, endUtc, locationTimezone)` — returns boolean
- [ ] `getAvailabilityInUtc(window, userHomeTimezone, targetDate)` — converts recurring window to UTC for that date, handles DST
- [ ] `getWeekBounds(date, timezone)` — returns UTC start/end of week (Mon–Sun) in given timezone

---

## Day 2 — Workflows

### Shift Management (Manager)
- [ ] Create shift modal — location, date, start time, end time, skill, headcount
- [ ] Edit shift modal — same fields, blocks edit if past cutoff
- [ ] Delete shift action — only allowed for `draft` status
- [ ] Cutoff enforcement: read `edit_cutoff_hours` from settings, block edits within window
- [ ] Validation: end time can be before start time only if overnight (mark `isOvernight` true)
- [ ] Auto-recompute `isPremium` on create/edit
- [ ] Trigger swap auto-cancellation on edit (if pending swap exists for this shift)

### Shift Assignment (Manager)
- [ ] "Assign staff" button on each shift card (shown if assigned_count < headcount)
- [ ] Staff search/picker filtered by: skill, certification, availability, scope
- [ ] Run constraint checks before saving — show violations inline with severity
- [ ] Show alternative suggestions when a constraint fails (block or override)
- [ ] Override flow for weekly 40h and 7th-day blocks (reason input required, saved to overtime_overrides)
- [ ] Optimistic locking: `BEGIN; SELECT ... FOR UPDATE; re-check constraints; INSERT; COMMIT`
- [ ] Conflict error UI: "This staff member was just assigned to [Other Shift] by [Name]. Please refresh."
- [ ] Remove assignment action (writes audit log)
- [ ] What-if preview — shows hour totals impact before confirming

### Schedule Publish/Unpublish
- [ ] Publish week action (changes all draft shifts in selected week → published)
- [ ] On publish: send "schedule published" notifications to all assigned staff
- [ ] Unpublish week action (only allowed if cutoff has not passed)
- [ ] On unpublish: send notifications to affected staff
- [ ] Audit log entries for both actions

### Swap & Drop Request Workflow
- [ ] Staff "my shifts" page — see upcoming shifts, request swap or drop button on each
- [ ] Initiate swap modal: select target staff (filtered to qualified)
- [ ] Initiate drop modal: confirm and submit
- [ ] Validation: max 3 pending swap/drop per staff member
- [ ] Validation: target staff must pass all constraints + not be at 3 pending themselves
- [ ] Notification to Staff B on swap request (with deep link)
- [ ] Notification to qualified staff at location on drop request
- [ ] Staff B accept/decline UI on incoming swap requests
- [ ] Staff "available drops" page — see drop shifts they're qualified for + claim button
- [ ] Notification to manager on swap accept or drop claim
- [ ] Manager swap/drop approval queue page
- [ ] Manager approve action: updates assignment, notifies all parties, audit log
- [ ] Manager reject action: restores original, notifies all parties, audit log
- [ ] Staff A cancel action: allowed at any time before manager approves
- [ ] Auto-cancel on shift edit + notification to all parties
- [ ] Drop request expiry job — cron or check at query time (24h before shift start)
- [ ] Auto-expire writes audit log + notifies original requester

### Overtime & Labor Compliance
- [ ] Weekly hours tracker (computed per staff per week)
- [ ] Daily hours tracker (computed per staff per day in their home tz)
- [ ] Consecutive day tracker (computed per staff)
- [ ] Warning UI on assignment when staff hits 35h weekly
- [ ] Warning UI at 8h daily, 6th consecutive day
- [ ] Hard block UI at 12h daily (no override)
- [ ] Override flow at 40h weekly (reason required, saved)
- [ ] Override flow at 7th consecutive day (reason required, saved)
- [ ] Manager notification when override exercised by anyone at their location
- [ ] Overtime dashboard — weekly view with projected hours per staff + projected cost (assume $20/h base + 1.5x over 40h, document this assumption)
- [ ] Highlighting: which specific assignments are pushing each staff into overtime
- [ ] What-if impact panel before confirming an assignment

### Notifications System
- [ ] `/lib/notifications.ts` — `notify(userId, type, title, body, metadata?)` inserts to DB + writes to simulated_emails if pref enabled
- [ ] Wire all notification triggers from CLAUDE.md list
- [ ] Notification center UI — bell icon in header, dropdown panel
- [ ] Unread count badge on bell
- [ ] Mark as read (click individual + "mark all read" button)
- [ ] Notification deep-links open the relevant entity (shift, swap, etc.)
- [ ] Notification preferences page — toggle email simulation
- [ ] Admin "simulated emails" viewer at `/admin/simulated-emails`

### Real-Time (Supabase Realtime ↔ TanStack Query)
- [ ] Enable replication on `shifts`, `shift_assignments`, `swap_requests`, `notifications` tables (Supabase dashboard → Database → Replication)
- [ ] Create `/hooks/useRealtimeSync.ts` — subscribes to all 4 tables, calls `queryClient.invalidateQueries([key])` on changes
- [ ] Mount realtime sync hook in dashboard layout (runs once per session)
- [ ] Subscribe to `shifts` changes → invalidate `['shifts', weekStart]` queries
- [ ] Subscribe to `shift_assignments` changes → invalidate `['assignments']` and `['on-duty']` queries
- [ ] Subscribe to `swap_requests` changes → invalidate `['swap-requests']` queries for affected user
- [ ] Subscribe to `notifications` → invalidate `['notifications', userId]` query
- [ ] Filter all subscriptions by user's accessible locations (RLS-style filter)
- [ ] On reconnect: refetch all active queries (TanStack Query's `refetchOnReconnect` already does this — verify enabled)
- [ ] On-duty dashboard page — server component for initial load + client component with TanStack Query for live updates
- [ ] On-duty: 60-second polling fallback (`refetchInterval`) for time-based transitions
- [ ] Test cross-tab: open two browser windows, change in tab A appears in tab B within 1 second

### TanStack Query Hooks (`/hooks/queries` and `/hooks/mutations`)
- [ ] `useShifts(weekStart, locationId)` — query for schedule view
- [ ] `useStaff(locationId)` — query for staff picker
- [ ] `useSwapRequests(userId)` — query for swap inbox
- [ ] `useNotifications(userId)` — query for notification center
- [ ] `useOnDuty(locationId)` — query with polling fallback
- [ ] `useAssignStaff()` — mutation with `onMutate` (optimistic), `onError` (rollback), `onSettled` (invalidate)
- [ ] `useUnassignStaff()` — mutation with same pattern
- [ ] `useCreateShift()` — mutation
- [ ] `useEditShift()` — mutation (also auto-cancels pending swaps server-side)
- [ ] `useDeleteShift()` — mutation (only draft shifts)
- [ ] `usePublishWeek()` — mutation
- [ ] `useUnpublishWeek()` — mutation
- [ ] `useCreateSwapRequest()` — mutation
